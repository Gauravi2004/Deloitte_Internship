# Deloitte Data Analytics  Internship

This repository contains projects completed during the **Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship** hosted on Forage. The internship simulated real-world business scenarios involving factory operations and HR analytics using industry tools like **Tableau** and **Excel**.

## 📊 Project 1: Factory Downtime Analysis (Tableau)

**Objective:**  
Analyze machine telemetry data collected from four global factories to identify downtime trends and operational inefficiencies.

**Key Highlights:**
- Created a calculated field `Unhealthy` to represent potential machine breakdown time (10 minutes per error).
- Built two bar charts in Tableau:
  - **Downtime per Factory**
  - **Downtime per Device Type**
- Designed an interactive dashboard with filtering capabilities to drill down by factory.
- Identified the factory and machine types with the most downtime.

## 📈 Project 2: Pay Equity Classification (Excel)

**Objective:**  
Classify compensation fairness across job roles and factory locations using equality scores.

**Key Highlights:**
- Used Excel to create a new column: `Equality Class`
- Applied logical conditions to classify each score into:
  - **Fair** (−10 to +10)
  - **Unfair** (−20 to −11 and 11 to 20)
  - **Highly Discriminative** (below −20 or above +20)
- Demonstrated basic HR analytics and DEI-focused classification using formula logic.
